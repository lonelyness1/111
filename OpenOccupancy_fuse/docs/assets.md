**Note that the mIoU is silighter higher than those in our paper (see logs for more details). Bellow are several changes in the training phase:**
- We use SyncBN instead of BN/GN, which enhances the mIoU by ~0.3.
- The total training epoch is 15 instead of 24, which significantly reduces the training time.
- The models are trained with [annotation-v0.1](./prepare_data.md) (with less occupancy artifacts).
